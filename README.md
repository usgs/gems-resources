# GeMS Resources
## Files and links to help understand, create, and manage [GeMS](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/GeMS/) databases

Most of the files in this repository were previously distributed within the 'Resources' folder of the GeMS Tools ArcGIS geoprocessing toolbox, which is available for [ArcMap](https://github.com/usgs/gems-tools-arcmap) and [ArcGIS Pro](https://github.com/usgs/gems-tools-pro). To avoid the redundant downloading of files in the case where both versions of the toolbox are required and because these files do not need to be versioned in the same way that the tool scripts do, they have been separated from the toolbox.

You can download all files at once using the Download ZIP option in the drop-down menu accessed from the green Code button above or each file individually using the links below.

## Delivery
* [GeMS_Transmittal_Letter](https://github.com/usgs/gems-resources/raw/main/gems-resources/GeMS_Transmittal_Letter.pdf) — Suggestions for the content of a transmittal letter to accompany a GeMS deliverable package
* [GeMS Checklist.pdf](https://github.com/usgs/gems-resources/raw/main/gems-resources/GeMS%20checklist.pdf) — Form to help with the collection of items before delivery of a GeMS database to, for example, the National Geologic Map Database ([NGMDB](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/ngmdb/ngmdb_home.html)) or [STATEMAP](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-cooperative-geologic-mapping-program/science/statemap?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

## Documentation
* [tm11b10.pdf](https://github.com/usgs/gems-resources/raw/main/gems-resources/tm11b10.pdf) — Current version of the GeMS standard
* [GeoMaterials.xlsx](https://github.com/usgs/gems-resources/raw/main/gems-resources/GeoMaterials.xlsx) — Terms and definitions from Appendix 1 of the GeMS documentation, in spreadsheet form

## Symbology
* [FGDC Digital Cartographic Standard for Geologic Map Symbolization](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/11A02/)
* [FGDCGeoAge.otf](https://github.com/usgs/gems-resources/raw/main/gems-resources/FGDCGeoAge.otf) — OpenType font of special geologic age characters

*Installation of fonts on older versions of Windows will require admin privileges, but on any Windows 10 system updated since late 2018 (v. 1809), regular users can install fonts in their user profile directory and they will be recognized by the system. Note that to make the fonts available to all users, admin privileges are required.*
