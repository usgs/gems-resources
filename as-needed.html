			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Some geologic maps contain features other than contacts, faults, and map-unit polygons. If such features are present in a geologic map report, they should be digitally encoded in the map database. If such elements are not present, the corresponding feature classes need not be included in the database; therefore, these feature classes are as-needed elements. Examples of these types of features are foliation, lineation, and bedding measurements; various sample localities for fossil, geochemical, and geochronological analyses; localities of field photographs; fold axes (or, more precisely, traces of fold-hinge surfaces); structure contours; concentration contours; former ice limits and ice-flow lines; cross-section lines; and areas of mineralization or manmade fill (both commonly depicted as overlays).</p>
			<p>Many such types of features exist, and there are many ways to partition these types of features into feature classes. At one extreme, each feature type can be represented by a separate feature class, in which case, the Type field of that feature class is redundant. At the other extreme, all feature types that have the same kind of geometry (that is, point, line, or polygon) can be assigned to a single feature class and then differentiated by the Type attribute. In the latter case, one might be tempted to add a plethora of attribute fields to the feature class; however, many attributes are likely to be left unpopulated for many features. For example, if age-sample localities and bedding measurements were recorded in a single point feature class, sample number would be irrelevant for bedding measurements, and strike and dip would be irrelevant for age-sample localities.</p>
			<p>In discussions with colleagues, we have been unable to agree on a best partitioning because different cases of database use suggest different ways of partitioning. And because we see no best partitioning, we do not prescribe the use of particular as-needed feature classes. Instead, we present guidelines for designing and naming feature classes, we discuss principles that govern the structure of point data, and we present several examples of as-needed feature classes. Note that if a GeMS database uses any of the feature classes described here, such feature classes should conform to these descriptions. For example, do not invent your own GeologicLines feature class that has different attributes than the ones we describe; you are free to create and use an additional feature class, but it needs to have a different name.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="white-bg">
			<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines for Naming and Designing Additional Feature Classes</h2>
                <p>When naming and designing additional feature classes, follow these guidelines:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The feature class name emphasizes the identity of the feature class.</li>
					<li>The feature class name includes one of the terms “Points”, “Lines”, or “Polys” (as appropriate), except when it would be redundant (for example, ContactsAndFaults, not ContactsAndFaultsLines, and Stations, not StationPoints).</li>
					<li>Feature class names and field names typically are compound words written in PascalCase.</li> 
					<li>Feature class names and field names do not contain spaces or underscores, with one exception (see next guideline).</li>
					<li>Every feature class has a primary key field named <em>FeatureClassName</em>_ID (note that this is the sole exception to the previous no underscores guideline).</li>
					<li>Every feature class has at least one <em>source</em>ID field. If each feature has a single source, this field typically is named DataSourceID; if the data source is compound (for example, sample analyses commonly have different sources for the sample location and for the associated sample analysis), there will be multiple <em>source</em>ID fields (for example, LocationSourceID and AnalysisSourceID).</li>
					<li>The fields ExistenceConfidence, IdentityConfidence, LocationConfidenceMeters, and similar confidence fields are included as appropriate.</li>
					<li>All fields that contain measured attributes, or attributes that represent real-world quantities (for example, strike, dip, concentration, location confidence), are data type = float; note that it may be necessary to define conventions for representing null values (for example, value = −9) and then document these conventions in the feature-class metadata.</li>
					<li>All attributes of a feature class should be populated for most features: if a feature class has one or more attributes that are not applicable to some subset of features in the class, consider placing those features in a separate feature class that has a more appropriate subset of attributes.</li>
					<li>Consider combining small feature classes that have a common attribute structure.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the sections that follow, we discuss the basic structure of point data and point feature classes in general, and we describe four examples of as-needed point feature classes (“<a href="#orientationpoints">OrientationPoints</a>”, “<a href="#geochronpoints">GeochronPoints</a>”, “<a href="#stations">Stations</a>”, and “<a href="#mapunitpoints">MapUnitPoints</a>”). We also discuss the as-needed feature classes “<a href="#geologiclines">GeologicLines</a>”, “<a href="#mapunitlines">MapUnitLines</a>”, “<a href="#cartographiclines">CartographicLines</a>”, “<a href="#isovaluelines">IsoValueLines</a>”, “<a href="#overlayPoly">MapUnitOverlayPolys</a>”, “<a href="#overlayPoly">OverlayPolys</a>”, and “<a href="#datasourcepolys">DataSourcePolys</a>”. Other possible as-needed feature classes might include “GeochemPoints”, “PhotoPoints”, “FieldNotePoints”, “SamplePoints”, “FossilPoints”, “FoldLines”, and “DikeLines”.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="white-bg">
			<h2 id="structure">Structure of Point Data</h2>
                <p>Observations of structure orientations and mineral occurrences, as well as collections of samples for geochemical, paleontologic, geochronologic, and other kinds of analyses, are made at field stations. Two modes are possible for representing such observations, localities, and related analyses and their accompanying locations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A normalized mode, in which (1) a “Stations” feature class stores location information and data specific to the station, (2) a nonspatial “Sample” table stores information on samples related to stations, and (3) other nonspatial tables store observations and analyses, one for each observation or analysis type, related to either a sample or station.</li>
					<li>A denormalized mode, in which there is a separate feature class for each type of observation or analysis; in some cases, this results in duplicate station-location and sample information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Each mode has advantages. The first mode allows error-resistant editing of location and sample information (the station data is recorded in only one place) and is well suited for data-management and -archiving systems. The second mode facilitates the symbolization and organization of point data in map layers in a GIS viewing environment that does not require joins or filtering, and it is more convenient for exporting analytical information from a source database by simply copying the relevant feature class.</p>
				<p>Because GeMS is designed primarily for publishing, not creating, geologic map data, we endorse the second mode. However, we note that, to create a GeMS-compliant database, it may be useful to start in the first mode by creating a Stations point feature class that has related data tables (including a Samples table) and then, from these, creating the appropriate data-type-specific point feature classes that will be included in the delivery database.</p>
					<h3 class="h4">Point Feature Classes in General</h3>
						<p>We recommend that typical point feature classes contain certain basic fields (table 20). We also recommend that sample-oriented point feature classes include certain additional fields (table 21). Note that the MapUnit field, whose value is to be obtained by intersection of a point feature class with the <a href="required.html#mapunitpoly">MapUnitPolys feature class</a>, is included so that a point feature class may be extracted from its host database and used elsewhere while retaining some geologic context for the point features. Values of MapUnit should not be null, except for points that lie outside the extent of the MapUnitPolys feature class.</p>

					<h3 class="h4" id="overlayPoly">Overlay Polygons (the MapUnitOverlayPolys and OverlayPolys Polygon Feature Classes)</h3>
						<p>Geologic maps sometimes show, in addition to the map-unit polygons, areas of overlying material(s) or some other aspect of earth materials or character (for example, a dike swarm or an alteration zone); such areas may lie entirely within a map-unit polygon, or they may cross over several polygons. On the map graphic, such overlying material commonly is shown by an overlay pattern (for example, diagonal lines or scattered red dots) overprinted onto the map-unit color; the edges of such overlays usually are shown by a scratch boundary (that is, without a bounding line).</p>
						<p>These overlay polygons are not part of the set of map-unit polygons that cover the map area without gaps or overlaps; thus, they do not belong in the feature class MapUnitPolys. The topological relations among these overlay polygons are likely to be complicated (for example, alteration-zone boundaries usually do not coincide with bedrock-map-unit boundaries, but they can coincide with some faults and with unconsolidated-deposit boundaries). And so, they are not easily prescribed by a simple set of rules; however, they usually fall into one of the following two general categories:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Some overlay polygons are described in the DMU along with the map-unit polygons. For example, in Booth and others (2009), the first four units listed in the DMU (modified land, m; graded areas, gr; artificial fill, af; and landfill debris, afl) are shown as overlay polygons. In the GeMS schema, such overlay polygons should be described in the feature class MapUnitOverlayPolys, in which the MapUnit field references an entry in the DescriptionOfMapUnits table.</li>
							<li>Some overlay polygons are described in the Explanation of Map Symbols along with other symbols such as contacts and bedding attitudes. For example, in Castor and others (2013), phyllosilicate alteration is shown as a stipple (dot) overlay that is identified in the symbol explanation with the contacts, faults, various vein types, and strike and dip symbols. Unlike modified land in Booth and others (2009), phyllosilicate alteration is not treated as a map unit in Castor and others (2013). In the GeMS schema, such overlay polygons should be described in the feature class OverlayPolys, in which the Type field references an entry in the Glossary table.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If some types of overlay polygons on a map have additional attributes, it may be useful to divide these into multiple feature classes, in which the division is based on the necessary attribute structure. Tables 29 and 30 describe the fields (and their values) that populate the MapUnitOverlayPolys feature class and the OverlayPolys feature class, respectively.</p>
